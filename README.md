## Section 0: Introduction

This is a guide on how to install and configure a debloated Fedora system that will hopefully be good for beginners and experts alike, we will be covering how to install the base system as well as configuring the installed system to get you what you need for your Linux system.

Why is this guide a thing? Doesn't a normal install work?

In the past I used Arch based distros and I liked how minimal the base system was and when I wanted something a little more stable and user Friendly Fedora was of interest. You could just install Fedora workstation as it is and move on with your life but I feel that 1800 or so packages on a vanilla fresh install is a little bit too much.

## Section 1: Prerequisites

You will need the following to install the new system:
- An Existing X86 computer with all data backed up
- An Internet Connection
- A 2nd Computer to ssh into the Fedora one
- A 4GB Flashdrive
- The Fedora Everything ISO which you can download [here]([https://pages.github.com/](https://alt.fedoraproject.org/)https://alt.fedoraproject.org/)
- Balena Etcher downloaded

## Section 2: Installation

I need to get to bed so this will be done another time
